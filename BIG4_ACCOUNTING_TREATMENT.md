## The Correct Entries

### Day 0 - Initial Recognition

```
Entry 1: Record Cash and Set Up Contract Liability
DR: Cash                               $2,100,000
DR: Discount on Contract Liability       $330,805
    CR: Deferred Revenue (Gross)                    $2,100,000

Net Contract Liability = $2,100,000 - $330,805 = $1,769,195
```

### Day 0 - License Revenue

```
Entry 2: Recognize License (20% of PV)
DR: Deferred Revenue (Gross)    $353,839
    CR: License Revenue                  $353,839
```

**Balances After Day 0:**
- Deferred Revenue (Gross): $1,746,161 CR
- Discount: $330,805 DR
- **Net Contract Liability: $1,415,356 CR**

## Monthly Entries (×60)

### Entry A: Support Revenue Recognition

```
DR: Deferred Revenue (Gross)    $23,590
    CR: Support Revenue                  $23,590
```

This reduces the **gross** deferred revenue.

### Entry B: Interest Expense (Unwind Discount)

```
DR: Interest Expense            $X
    CR: Discount on Contract Liability   $X

Where X = Opening Net Contract Liability × 0.004868
```

This reduces the **discount** (contra-liability).

## Perfect Reconciliation

### Total Revenue = PV
- License Revenue (Day 0): $353,839
- Support Revenue (60 months): $1,415,356
- **Total Revenue: $1,769,195** ✅ (equals PV)

### Total Interest Expense = Discount
- Sum of 60 monthly interest expenses: **$330,805** ✅

### Revenue + Interest = Cash
- $1,769,195 + $330,805 = **$2,100,000** ✅

**Everything reconciles perfectly!** 🎉

## Why This Is Correct

1. **Deferred Revenue** reduced only by revenue recognition (support)
2. **Discount** reduced only by interest expense (unwinds over time)
3. **Both go to $0** at the end
4. **Interest is an expense**, not income (customer is providing financing to you!)
5. **Clean separation** of revenue vs. financing
