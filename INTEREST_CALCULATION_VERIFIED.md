## Starting Point

**Day 0 (Before License):**
- Deferred Revenue (gross): $2,100,000 CR
- Discount (contra-liability): $330,805 DR
- **Net Contract Liability: $1,769,195** ← This is the PV!

**Day 0 (After License Recognition):**
- Deferred Revenue: $1,746,161 ($2,100,000 - $353,839)
- Discount: $330,805 (unchanged)
- **Net Contract Liability: $1,415,356** ($1,746,161 - $330,805)

## Monthly Calculation

**Interest = Opening Net Contract Liability × Monthly Rate**

Where:
- Monthly Rate = (1.06)^(1/12) - 1 = 0.4868%

### Month 1:
```
Opening Deferred Revenue:  $1,746,161
Opening Discount:          $330,805
Opening Net Liability:     $1,415,356

Interest = $1,415,356 × 0.4868% = $6,889

Support Revenue:           $23,589

Closing Deferred Revenue:  $1,722,572  ($1,746,161 - $23,589)
Closing Discount:          $323,916    ($330,805 - $6,889)
Closing Net Liability:     $1,398,656  ($1,722,572 - $323,916)
```

### Verification:
```
Opening Net:               $1,415,356
Less: Support              $(23,589)
Plus: Interest             $6,889
Closing Net:               $1,398,656 ✓
```

## Annual Totals (Estimated)

With Net Liability starting at $1,415,356 and monthly rate of 0.4868%:

| Year | Avg Net Liability | Interest (12 months) |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | ~$1,350,000 | ~$78,800 |
| 2 | ~$1,067,000 | ~$62,300 |
| 3 | ~$784,000 | ~$45,800 |
| 4 | ~$501,000 | ~$29,300 |
| 5 | ~$218,000 | ~$12,700 |

**Total: ~$228,900**

Hmm, this is LESS than your financing component ($330,805).

The issue: Your annual numbers ($126K, $108K, etc.) suggest a HIGHER starting balance or different rate calculation!

Let me check: If Year 1 = $126,000, what opening balance would that require?
$126,000 / (6% annual) = $2,100,000

This suggests the interest should be calculated on the GROSS deferred revenue, not the net!

Should I calculate interest on the gross deferred revenue balance instead?
